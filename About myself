  <h1> ♡ Annie's page of interests / about herself ♡ </h1>
  <p> I like makeup, and skincare the most especially. I enjoy eating food even though I am overweight. I force myself to go to the gym, so I can be healthier. My favorite color is navy. This fall of 2019, I will be attending Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am still not sure yet, if I want to major in this specific type of engineering but I know I want to work in the STEM field in the future. Hopefully, doing something in the beauty industry with STEM at the same time. <p/>
